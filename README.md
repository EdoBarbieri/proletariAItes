# proletariAItes

Here's a copy of my first zine, written in April 2022 as my final project of the course "Conceptualizing Human Geography", part of my MRes in Human Geography.

The aim was to engage with a young left-leaning target demographic, to inform them on the impact of AI and the use of quantitative methodologies when used to gather information from social spaces.
To do so, I decided to use a media (i.e., the zine) that has been used as an alt-information tool, while using a post-modern aesthetic more similar to the one used by the magazine Jacobin, or by Breadtubers.
